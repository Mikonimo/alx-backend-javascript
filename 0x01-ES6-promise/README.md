## ES6 Promise
The `promise` object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asychronous operation and its resulting value.
A promise is in one of these states:
- *pending*: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- *fulfilled*: meaning that the operation was completed successfuly
- *rejected*: meaning that the operation failed.
